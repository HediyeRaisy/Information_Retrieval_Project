# Information_Retrieval_Project
This is a project for Introduction to Information Retrieval . We crawl the html page from www.alluniversity.info/world-top-100/ and get the info of 100 top universities and save them as documents. After cleaning the documents, we draw tf-idf matrix for each term. We also define a function for calculating similarities with cosine for each query that user enters. The function calculates the similarities for each documents and show top of the search results in the code.
